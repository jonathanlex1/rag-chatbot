# rag_chatbot
A context-aware chatbot using Meta's LLaMA model via Groq API, enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It supports conversational history and is served through a FastAPI backend. The chatbot is accessed via a Streamlit UI that communicates with the API. LLM interactions are tracked using LangSmith for monitoring and debugging.
